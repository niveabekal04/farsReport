# farsReport
Creating a package
The goal of farsReport is to allow easy reporting of standard formatted FARS accident reports.

The package contains data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes. The package allows easy reporting of FARS data sets from 2013, 2014 and 2015.
